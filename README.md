# AT03 RPG Game README

## Intro
### The purpose of this document is to provide a guide and introduction to the AT03 RPG Game project. 

## Project Summary 
### 

With this project we are aiming to create a small but feature-complete game prototype that simulates a simple RPG adventure experience. It will have functional systems like player movement, camera control, and basic saving, loading, and respawning, and furthermore include fundamental RPG systems like choice-based dialogue, stats and levelling, and interactions with the environment.
