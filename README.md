# AT03 RPG Game README

## Intro
### The purpose of this document is to provide a guide and introduction to the AT03 RPG Game project. 

## Project Summary 
### 

With this project we are aiming to create a small but feature-complete game prototype that simulates a simple RPG adventure experience. It will have functional systems like player movement, camera control, and basic saving, loading, and respawning, and furthermore include fundamental RPG systems like choice-based dialogue, stats and levelling, and interactions with the environment. 

## Team Members & Assigned Features
### This section is to outline the project's current team members and which of the features each member is responsible for. 

| Team Member   | Feature       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Ethan         | Camera Control, Player Movement, Interactions     |
| Elijah        | Main Menu, Saving Systems     |
| Bri           | Dialogue, Respawn, Stats & Levelling     |

Note: A more detailed breakdown of each feature is available further down in this document.

## Technical Specifications
This section covers practices such as branch naming conventions, file structure, and commit directions.

### Branch Naming Conventions

All branches should follow the camel casing for the name of the branch. Also, ensure you use descriptive names with no abbreviation, otherwise it may be hard to identify.

For branches that focus on features, the branch naming convention should be:
- 'feature/Feature-Name'<br>

For branches that focus on bug fixing, the branch naming convention should be:
- 'bugfix/ErrorName'<br>

For branches that express a release version change, the branch naming convention should be:
-'version/VersionNumber'<br>
### File Structure
When structuring your files, keep it clear and simple, ensuring the structure makes sense to both yourself and your teammates. All files should be stored either on the GitHub repository, or on a company device.
### Commit Directions
When committing, you have to ensure you do it correctly in order to avoid merge conflicts and making your teammates lose progress.

In order to properly commit, you should ALWAYS pull origin so you have your teammates most recent work. Once you have done that, stage the recorded changes to change only what you need. Once you have done that, name the commit into something meaningful that summarizes the purpose of the commit, that way it can help teammates understand what the commit is for. Once you have done that, you can then commit the changes into the branch.

### Other File Naming Conventions
Other file naming conventions involve:
- For models, you should use pascal case and use the m_ suffix. Give it a clear name and then state the version it is. Finally, separate the suffix, name and version with underscores. An example as to how this would play out is: m_barrel_v2.mb
- For textures, you shoud use pascal case and use the tex_ suffix. Give it a descriptive name outlining what it is and what version it is. You should also separate the suffix, name and version with underscores. An example as to how this would play out is: tex_barrel_v2.png
- For unity projects, camel case should be used, with the name of the file generally being the name of the game. An example of this would be: RolePlayingGame file
